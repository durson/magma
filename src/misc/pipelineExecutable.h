    /* When a pipeline is created, its state and shaders are
       compiled into zero or more device-specific executables,
       which are used when executing commands against that pipeline.
       This extension adds a mechanism to query properties and
       statistics about the different executables produced by
       the pipeline compilation process. This is intended to be
       used by debugging and performance tools to allow them to
       provide more detailed information to the user. Certain
       compile-time shader statistics provided through this
       extension may be useful to developers for debugging or
       performance analysis. */
