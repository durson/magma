    /* When using a framebuffer with mixed samples, a per-fragment coverage reduction operation
       is performed which generates color sample coverage from the pixel coverage.
       This extension defines the following modes to control how this reduction is performed:

        * Merge: When there are more samples in the pixel coverage than color samples, there is an
          implementation-dependent association of each pixel coverage sample to a color sample.
          In the merge mode, the color sample coverage is computed such that only if any associated sample
          in the pixel coverage is covered, the color sample is covered. This is the default mode.

        * Truncate: When there are more raster samples (N) than color samples(M), there is one to one
          association of the first M raster samples to the M color samples; other raster samples are ignored. */
