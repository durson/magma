    /* An inline uniform block is almost identical to a uniform buffer,
       and differs only in taking its storage directly from the
       encompassing descriptor set instead of being backed by buffer
       memory. It is typically used to access a small set of constant
       data that does not require the additional flexibility provided
       by the indirection enabled when using a uniform buffer where
       the descriptor and the referenced buffer memory are decoupled.
       Compared to push constants, they allow reusing the same set of
       constant data across multiple disjoint sets of drawing and
       dispatching commands. */
