    /* Allows to create large descriptor sets containing substantially
       all of application resources, and selecting amongst those
       resources with dynamic (non-uniform) indexes in the shader.

        * Descriptors can be updated after they are bound to a command
          buffer, such that the execution of the command buffer reflects
          the most recent update to the descriptors.
        * Descriptors that are not used by any pending command buffers
          can be updated, which enables writing new descriptors for
          frame N+1 while frame N is executing.
        * Relax the requirement that all descriptors in a binding that
          is "statically used" must be valid, such that descriptors that
          are not accessed by a submission need not be valid and can be
          updated while that submission is executing.
        * The final binding in a descriptor set layout can have a
          variable size. */
